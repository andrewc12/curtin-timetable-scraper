the main things I want to work on are
- persistant state
- batch add multiple units (12) before viewing
- multithreading/worker pool
- dumping/cacheing the timetable pages
- with the previous three i should be able to have
    - a worker pool for downloading timetables
    - use a worker pool using beautifulsoup4 for processing the timetables (this frees up selenium to download another page)
- json output
- some metadata about the staleness
- an API
- hosting
